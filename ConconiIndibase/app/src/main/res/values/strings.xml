    <string name="recover_training_explanation">If you are weary from a workout, you can do two things: take rest or do recovery training. The first method is usually sufficient, but sometimes it is better to promote recovery by doing a recovery training. With a recovery training you promote the excretion of waste from your muscles and blood flow to your muscles.

Its important that you feel better after a recovery training than before training. Is that not the case, then you have cycled too hard.</string>
    <string name="recover_training_howTo">Because the pace is slow, it does not matter which bike you perform the exercise. So this may be a road bike, but also the normal daily cycle is enough fine. Find a course without too many obstacles, such as bridges, and if the wind blows hard, with adequate shelter.</string>

    <string name="slow_endurance_training_slow_recoverTime">Depends on how long you train, 24 – 48 hours</string>
    <string name="slow_endurance_training_explanation">The quiet endurance training should be the most important in your training. Frequent doing this exercise you build an important basic condition on which you can expand later on. During a quiet endurance training teaches your body to effectively deal with the available resources (food, water, oxygen, etc.), so you at a later stage, such as during an arduous journey, can sustain these better.

A quiet endurance training is really quiet. Especially people who are not accustomed to the idea will have to slow cycling. This is just a matter of getting used to, because after a while the average speed during this training be higher than before at the high heart rate.

The low intensity exercise has two major advantages: the recovery is short, so you can quickly start training and the risk of injury is very small.</string>
    <string name="slow_endurance_training_howTo">
       In the first five minutes bring the heart rate to calm your D1 zone. Then try to drive as constant as possible with a leg heartbeat rate of at least 90 revolutions per minute. Upwind allowed several strokes heart rate is higher than with a tailwind.

The duration of the training you can make very long journeys, up to 150 kilometers. Is certainly important to have enough food and water to take and eat this time. To make the movement not too monotonous, you can occasionally take a bit short turn, for example, after a sharp bend to standing on the pedals to your expensive rate.</string>

        <p>
            <h3>Getting Ready</h3>
            Congratulations! You have acquired the Conconi test app developed for Android-based devices. Before using the app you have to verify that:
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>1.</b> You possess one compatible Bluetooth heartbeat sensor.
            <br/>
            <b>2.</b> Your Android device has Bluetooth connection.
            <br/>
            <b>3.</b> Your Android OS version is compatible with the App.
            <br/>
            <b>4.</b> The Conconi test app is installed in your device.
        </p>
        <p>
           If all the conditions mentioned above are fulfilled then the user can proceed into initializing the Conconi test app.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Guide</h3>
            To navigate through the app and tabs the user just needs to click on the tabs on the top section of the screen. In order to go back he can click the device “Back” button.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Starting</h3>
            <b>1.</b> Once the app is initialized and the user is in the main tab the first thing to do is click on the connect button to establish the connection with the Bluetooth heartbeat sensor. Keep in mind that to do this the Bluetooth receiver of your device must be on.
            <br/>
            <b>2.</b> When the sensor is connected proceed to click on the Play button to start the training session.
            <br/>
            <b>3.</b> Once you have finished your training session press on the Stop button to proceed to see the graph with the deflection point and the Conconi test information from the training. If you wish to delete the training click on the Cancel button. Please be aware that if you do this the training session will not be shown nor will it be stored in the database.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Training sessions history</h3>
            <b>1. </b>To see your previous stored training sessions you just need to go to the history tab and click on the training session you wish to check.
            <br/>
            <b>2. </b>The app will display the stored sessions by date.
            <br/>
            <b>3. </b>The stored information will show the deflection point as well as the graph with the Conconi test information.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Advice Section</h3>
            One of the premises for Group 4 before developing the Conconi test app was to be able to not only calculate the Deflection point and conduct the Conconi test, but to give advice to the user to help his/her improvement and overall health status. Thus in the advice section you can find the different advices sorted by training sessions.
            <br/>
            <b>1. </b>Once you are in the Advice tab click on the training session you want to see.
            <br/>
            <b>2. </b>The advice will be shown for that concrete session.

        <p>
            The test was first described by Italian Sport Scientist Francesco Conconi in 1982. It is a relatively simple field test which measures the heart rate at different predefined intensity levels, which can be used to estimate Anaerobic Threshold, a point at which the body predominately uses the anaerobic energy system. It is also known as the ramp test.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Purpose: </b>To determine the heart rate at the anaerobic threshold for setting training zones.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Equipment Required: </b>stopwatch, heart rate monitor (with recording and recall function), running track or exercise equipment.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Procedure: </b>This test can be conducted on any equipment or during any exercise mode. Start at an easy pace, then at pre-determined intervals increase the workload. Record your heart rate at the end of each speed/workload level. Continue exercising until exhaustion.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Scoring: </b>Plot the heart rate over speed/workload as a graph. Connect the points with a line. Initially the heart rate and workload graph should be linear. At a high intensity, the point where the line bends corresponds to your anaerobic threshold. Record your heart rate and workload at this point on the graph.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Accuracy: </b>This test assumes that the anaerobic threshold is related to a deflection point on the heart rate/intensity graph. Subsequent studies have found that the deflection point in heart rate only occurs in a certain individuals and that when it does, it significantly overestimates directly measured lactate threshold.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Target Population: </b>Endurance athletes (middle/long distance runners, cyclists, triathletes, rowers)
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Comments: </b>Even if the anaerobic threshold level is not an accurate measure, you can use this test to look at improvements in fitness as your heart rate at each workload should decrease as you get fitter. You can also get a measure of your maximum heart rate from this test.
